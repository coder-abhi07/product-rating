            Welcome to Product Rating!
I’m Abhishek Kumar, a student at Himachal Pradesh Technical University (HPTU), with a passion for technology and innovation.

At Product Rating, we’re dedicated to helping you make informed choices about the products you use. Our platform leverages cutting-edge technology to analyze product images and assess their health and safety based on harmful ingredient detection.

How It Works:
Simply upload an image of the product you want to evaluate, and our system will process it to identify any harmful ingredients. We then provide a rating on a scale of 100, reflecting the product’s overall safety and quality. This service is available for a wide range of products, from personal care items to food products.

Comprehensive Analysis: Our tool uses advanced image processing and ingredient matching to give you a clear understanding of a product’s safety.
User-Friendly: Uploading an image and receiving a rating is quick and easy.
